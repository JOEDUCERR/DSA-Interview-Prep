# 🧠 DSA Interview Prep (C++)

This repository contains all the C++ code I write while preparing for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interviews. It includes problems from topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, recursion, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder or file is categorized by topic or platform (e.g., Arrays, Trees, DP, Leetcode, etc.). Inside, you'll find:
- ✅ Solved problems
- 📌 Important patterns
- 🧠 Optimized solutions and approaches

## 🛠️ Language

All solutions are written in **C++** using a clean and consistent coding style.

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong DSA fundamentals, improve problem-solving speed, and be interview-ready!

## 📌 Topics Covered (Ongoing)

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sliding Window
- Bit Manipulation
- Sorting & Searching

## 📝 Notes

Some files include comments with explanations, time and space complexity, and alternate approaches.
